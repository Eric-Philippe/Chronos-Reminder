- This app is your **new personal time assistant**, easy to integrate into your daily life.

### Account management

The app allows you to create distinct accounts.

Ex:

- You create your Chronos discord account by only using the Discord Bot
- You can then create a App account starting from the already existing Discord account

- You can also create a new App account from scratch
- You can then link your Discord account to your App account

> In the future you'll be able to merge two accounts together (It will merge all your reminders and settings into one account)

> Being able to send emojis in the reminders
